Hi,

Your need for a Senior Full Stack Developer to finalize your AI-powered competitor research SaaS MVP, which is 75% built, is a perfect match for my expertise. I specialize in launching and scaling complex platforms, having led similar initiatives for Microsoft and Home Depot over 17 years.

**Relevant Experience:**
- Launched Connectful, a full-stack SaaS platform (React, Node.js, AWS) that acquired 720,000+ users in its first year.
- Built autonomous AI systems and conversational interfaces at Microsoft, leveraging advanced AI/ML.
- Drove $9.3M revenue increase at Indeed through design optimization and ML-powered matching systems.
- Architected scalable cloud solutions for a $20B personalized rewards platform at Home Depot.

My approach to understanding existing codebases involves a rapid architecture review and collaborative knowledge transfer to ensure seamless integration and efficient completion. Given your current LangChain and OpenAI implementation, have you established a clear strategy for prompt versioning and model evaluation to ensure consistent AI performance?

**Deliverables I can provide:**
- Finalized React frontend components and Python backend APIs, integrated with MongoDB and Redis.
- Production-ready AI integrations using LangChain and OpenAI, ensuring robust performance.
- Comprehensive documentation, unit/integration testing, and deployment support for launch.

I have extensive experience with React, Python, MongoDB, LangChain, and OpenAI integrations, including building RAG architectures. I am available to start immediately for the 1-week trial.

Best,
Christopher

Hi,

I'm highly interested in the Founding Full Stack Engineer role and your unique dual partnership model. My 17 years of experience building cutting-edge products for Microsoft, Home Depot, and Audi, combined with launching my own SaaS platform, aligns perfectly with your vision.

**Relevant Experience & SaaS Product:**
At Connectful, I launched a full-stack SaaS platform (React, Node.js, AWS) that acquired 720,000+ users in its first year. This involved architecting scalable systems and owning the technical roadmap from inception. (Product link available upon request).

**Technical Leadership & Partnership Interest:**
My approach to technical leadership, honed at Microsoft and Home Depot, focuses on owning the technical roadmap, fostering a culture of quality and speed, and translating complex technical concepts into clear business value for enterprise clients. I am very interested in the equity/partnership model, as I thrive in environments where I can drive significant product strategy and impact, similar to securing $1.2M funding for EDF Energy. For scaling a flagship SaaS product, I prioritize a modular, cloud-native architecture on AWS, ensuring high availability and cost-efficiency.

**Deliverables I can provide:**
- Lead engineering on your flagship SaaS product (React, Python/Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS)
- Client-facing technical leadership and strategic architectural guidance
