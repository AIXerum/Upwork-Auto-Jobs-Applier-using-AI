## ðŸš€ The Simple Method (No Server Needed!)

### How It Works:

1. **You find a job on Upwork** (with your filters)
2. **You copy the job description**
3. **You run a simple command** (generates cover letter)
4. **You paste it into Upwork**
5. **Click Send**

**Total time: 60-90 seconds per job** (still way faster than manual!)

## ðŸ“‹ Step-by-Step

### **When you find a job you want to apply to:**

**Step 1:** Copy the job description from Upwork

**Step 2:** Run this in Terminal:
